How the use the logistic regression algorithm, 

first, you need to run every script on the logisticRegressioTraning.ipynb
it will create the weight vector that you need to use in the prediction and also all the feature vector
to change the value of the training factor a, search for a variable name 'a'

Then, you need to run every scrip on the logisticRegressionPrediction.ipynb
It will create dataPrediction.csv which is the prediction for 2016

** Make shure the the Project1_data.vsc is in the root/Data folder
